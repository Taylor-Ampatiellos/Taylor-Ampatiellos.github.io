		<h1>My Bio</h1>

		<p>My two greatest passions are video games and music, and these have guided me throughout my life and college career.</p>

        <p>At the age of three I was already playing educational games such as those produced by JumpStart and The Learning Company, and I was absolutely hooked. I have these games to thank for strengthening my math, reading, and critical thinking skills from a very young age. Of course, as I grew older I began to play more mature games, but my favorites to this day are those that force the player to think, whether that is through puzzle elements or through a rich story.</p>           

        <p>My first experience with creating games of my own started in middle school, when I was introduced to Scratch, a programming application designed by the MIT Media Lab. Although simple in design, the projects I developed using Scratch gave me my first taste of programming years before I would take my first real computer science course. Fast-forwarding to my sophomore year at Tufts, I decided to take a Game Design/Development elective and realized that this concentration would be a perfect application for my already-in-progress computer science degree. Although my personal coding projects since have been primarily focused in the game development field, I also enjoy programming in general!</p>

        <p>Music, as I mentioned above, is also a huge part of my life. Seeing as I had a very outgoing personality as a kid, I was encouraged to explore the arts. I enjoyed performing so much that I took part in every musical, choir, and play I possibly could, and also took piano and tap lessons. Upon entering college I pursued a music minor, and my intensive background powered me to a minor GPA of 4.0.  During my freshman year I also joined the Tufts Beelzebubs, a top-ten collegiate a cappella group. My experience traveling the country and the world with this group has been absolutely incredible, and has ultimately shaped my time at Tufts as a whole.</p>

        <p>I truly believe that my broad-based liberal arts education from Tufts has not only prepared me for a successful computer science career, but has given me a solid foundation in the arts, sciences, and humanities that will be an asset to any company or team.</p>
