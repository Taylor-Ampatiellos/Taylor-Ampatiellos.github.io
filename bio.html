		<h1>My Bio</h1>

		<p>  My two greatest passions are music and video games, and this has guided me throughout life and my college career. </p>

        <p>  Because of my outgoing personality as a kid, I was encouraged to explore the arts. I enjoyed performing so much that I took part in every musical, choir, and play I possibly could, and also took piano and tap lessons. Upon entering college I pursued a music minor, and my intensive background powered me to a minor GPA of 4.0.  During my freshman year I also joined the Tufts Beelzebubs, a top-ten collegiate a cappella group. My experience traveling the country and the world with this group has been absolutely incredible, and has ultimately shaped my time at Tufts as a whole.  </p>

        <p>  As far as video games are concerned, at the age of three I was already playing educational games such as those produced by JumpStart and The Learning Company, and I was absolutely hooked. I have these games to thank for strengthening my math, reading, and critical thinking skills from a very young age. Of course, as I grew older I began to play more mature games, but my favorites to these day are those that force the player to think, whether that is through puzzle elements or through a rich story. During my sophomore year at Tufts, I decided to take a Game Design elective and realized that this concentration would be a perfect application for my already-in-progress computer science degree. Although my personal coding projects have been focused in the game development field, I also enjoy programming in general!  </p>

        <p>  I truly believe that my broad-based liberal arts education from Tufts has not only prepared me for a successful computer science career, but has given me a solid foundation in the arts, sciences, and humanities that will be an asset to any company or team.</p>
