Now that I am more comfortable with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, 
I have begun working on a custom website for myself.

My current website is hosted on Wix at https://taylorampatiellos.wixsite.com/profile.
Although I am very happy with how the site looks in its present state, I would much rather have a website
that not only adequately portrays by true web development skills, but also that I have more complete control over.
